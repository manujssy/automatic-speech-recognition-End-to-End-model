# Automatic-Speech-Recognition---End to End model

## *Automatic Speech Recognition using Advanced Deep Learning Approaches: A Survey*  

### *Overview*  
This project focuses on *Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)* using advanced deep learning techniques. Various neural network architectures have been implemented to achieve high accuracy in speech-to-text conversion. The dataset consists of labeled audio samples of spoken language.  

### *Implemented Models*  
The following deep learning models have been implemented for ASR:  
- *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*  
- *Artificial Neural Network (ANN)*  
- *Deep Neural Network (DNN)*  
- *Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)*  
- *End-to-End Models*  

### *Dataset*  
The dataset includes audio samples categorized into:  
- *Phoneme Recognition*  
- *Word-level Transcription*  
- *Sentence-level Transcription*  

Each sample is labeled for training and evaluation. Preprocessing includes *noise reduction, feature extraction, and normalization* to ensure data consistency.

### *Installation*  
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:  

#### *Clone the repository:*  
bash
git clone https:https://https://github.com/manujssy/automatic-speech-recognition-End-to-End-model.git
cd ASR-Deep-Learning

Run the Jupyter Notebooks to train and evaluate the models.  

### *Usage*  
- Open the .ipynb files in *Google Colab* or *Jupyter Notebook*.  
- Execute the cells to *load the dataset, train models, and evaluate performance*.  
- Modify hyperparameters in the notebook files as needed.  

### *Results*  
Each model has been evaluated using:  
- *Accuracy*  
- *Precision*  
- *Recall*  
- *F1-score*  

Performance comparisons and visualization results will be added to the results/ directory.  

### *Future Work*  
- Implement additional *deep learning models* for improved ASR performance.  
- *Optimize hyperparameters* for better accuracy.  
- *Integrate real-time ASR* for practical applications in speech recognition.
